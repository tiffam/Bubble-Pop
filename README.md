## Bubble Pop
A nostagic memory game for all ages! 
Memorise the sequence of popped bubbles on screen and reproduce it. 
Level up from Popper-In-Training and get a spot in our League of Poppers.

## Getting Started
Start the game [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tiffam/Bubble-Pop/blob/master/main.html).

## Approach taken

The game is designed to be intuitive for players to play. Players can play it from the onset. The game interface is kept simple and responsive. It can be broken down into 3 main sections - score, message and bubbles. 

A random pattern of 4 bubbles will be generated and displayed on screen. Players will win the game set by tapping on the bubbles in the correct sequence. As the game progresses, players will level up based on their scores: 

* Score of 0 - Popper-In-Training
* Score of 150 - Confirmed Popper
* Score of 1000 - Popper Expert status
* Score of 1500 - Member of the League of Poppers

The game can be played to infinity as long as player's scores do not dip below 0. Once it reaches negative value, the gameboard will vanish and that ends the game. Players can refresh the browser to play the game again.
