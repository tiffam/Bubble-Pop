## Bubble Pop
A fun and easy to play memory game for all ages! 
Follow the pattern shown on screen and see if you can rise up from Bubble Popper-In-Training and get a spot in our League of Poppers.

## Getting Started
Play the game by clicking [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tiffam/Bubble-Pop/blob/master/main.html).

## Approach taken

The game is playable from the onset. It is designed to be intuitive for users to play. The game interface is kept simple and responsive, and it can be broken down into 3 main sections - score, message and bubbles. A random pattern of 4 bubbles will be generated and it will display on screen in sequence. Users will win the game by tapping on the bubbles in the correct sequence. They get to level up the game based on their scores based on the following:

Score of 0 - Popper-In-Training
Score of 150 - Confirmed Popper
Score of 1000 - Popper Expert status
Score of 1500 - Member of the League of Poppers

The game can be played to infinity as long as user's scores do not dip below 0. Once it reaches negative value, the gameboard will vanish and that ends the game. Users can refresh the browser to play the game again.
